Rockfall Prediction and Alert System

üìå Abstract

Rockfalls are a major hazard in open-pit mining, threatening worker safety, equipment integrity, and operational continuity. Traditional monitoring methods (manual inspections or costly systems) are reactive, slow, and economically unsustainable.

This project proposes an AI-powered Rockfall Prediction and Alert System that integrates IoT sensors, drone imagery, and digital elevation models (DEM) into a unified framework. The system leverages machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to provide predictive insights and proactive alerts, thereby enhancing safety and sustainability in mining operations.

üéØ Objectives

Predict rockfall susceptibility using multimodal data sources.

Provide real-time alerts through a user-friendly dashboard.

Enhance operational efficiency by reducing unplanned downtime.

Promote safety and sustainability in open-pit mining.
